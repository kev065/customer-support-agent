# This file is a placeholder for setting up the Airbyte sync between Postgres and Qdrant.
# Setting up an Airbyte connection requires manual configuration through the Airbyte UI.

# 1. Set up a Postgres source connector in Airbyte:
#    - Connect to your Postgres database using the credentials in the .env file.
#    - Configure the replication frequency and select the tables to sync (users, products, orders, order_items).

# 2. Set up a Qdrant destination connector in Airbyte:
#    - Connect to your Qdrant instance using the credentials in the .env file.
#    - Configure the collection name and other Qdrant-specific settings.

# 3. Create a connection in Airbyte to sync the data from the Postgres source to the Qdrant destination.
#    - Configure the sync mode (e.g., full refresh, incremental).
#    - Map the columns from the Postgres tables to the fields in the Qdrant collection.

# 4. Run the Airbyte sync to start replicating the data.

print("Please set up the Airbyte connection manually through the Airbyte UI.")
